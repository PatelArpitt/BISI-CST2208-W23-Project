# Introduction
Is diabetes more prevalent among Pima Indians?

The rate of type 2 diabetes among Pima Indians is the highest in the world at 34.2% for men and 40.8% for women, compared to 9.3% for the general population of the United States (U.S.) and 16% for Native Americans overall.

In the Pimas, obesity and diabetes have both increased in prevalence over the past century, possibly as a result of quick cultural and dietary shifts in a group predisposed to diabetes genetically. Many other regions of the world appear to be experiencing comparable rises in diabetes and obesity.

# Objectives and Steps
- This Python Notebook operates on the `diabetes.csv` file which stores the information about the obesity and diabetes levels of a certain set of people (Pima Indians), alongwith the information about the sexes, age, skin thickness, etc. which may factor in the overcoming of Diabetes in the tribe.
- In the Python Notebook, there are script snippets and models which have been trained upon the dataset, the dataset is of high quality which doesn't require data cleaning process.
- After determining the statistical nature of the data, we have answered a lot of questions after processing the data accordingly.
- Lastly, we have made comparisions between two distinct machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest. We trained the highly-sophisticated model from SKLearn Library using the `diabetes.csv` dataset.
